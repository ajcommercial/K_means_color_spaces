# K_means_color_spaces
This jupyter notebooks takes an input image and creates an list from a subset of it's pixels. First it shows the coordinates of these pixels in the RGB color space. In order to get a color scheme from this image, the values get clusters. Afterwards the list gets converted to the HSV space and clustered again. Afterwards the same is done for the LAB color space.
